        As it turns out, for "image" type objects, larger images are 
        available.
        The creation of the URL to grab the image needs to check the image
        object information before setting the URL. ContentDM has an image
        server that will resize the image on demand. We want images whose max
        dimension in height or width is 1024. Need to first get image info at
        the base URL then request an appropriately scaled image.
        This needs to be done after the sourceResouce/type is mapped, so it
        happens in update_mapped_fields
